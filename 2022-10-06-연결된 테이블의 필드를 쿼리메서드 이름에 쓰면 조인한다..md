select
        recordenti0_.record_id as record_i1_10_,
        recordenti0_.created_at as created_2_10_,
        recordenti0_.last_modified_at as last_mod3_10_,
        recordenti0_.appreciation_date as apprecia4_10_,
        recordenti0_.completed as complete5_10_,
        recordenti0_.content_id as content10_10_,
        recordenti0_.note as note6_10_,
        recordenti0_.nth as nth7_10_,
        recordenti0_.title as title8_10_,
        recordenti0_.user_id as user_id9_10_ 
    from
